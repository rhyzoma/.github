# Rhyzoma ðŸŒ±

**Rooted. Growing. Connected.**

Rhyzoma is an initiative inspired by the structure of rhizome roots â€” growing horizontally, branching freely, and staying deeply interconnected.

## ðŸŒ¿ Philosophy

We believe growth isnâ€™t always vertical. Like a rhizome, we expand through connections, build resilient networks, and grow strong foundations through collaboration, technology, and open ideas.

## ðŸ”§ Our Focus

- Sustainable software development  
- Open and inclusive collaboration  
- Exploration of decentralized systems  
- Minimalist and nature-inspired design approaches  

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Mission

To foster growth and innovation through structures that are organic, resilient, and interconnected.

## ðŸ”— Logo Symbolism

- **Rhizome Roots:** Representing networks and lateral growth  
- **Sprout:** Symbol of new ideas and innovation  
- **{ Code }:** Seamless integration of technology  
- **Natural Colors:** Bamboo green, earth brown, neutral gray â€” reflecting harmony between nature and modernity
